- You're currently working your 1st shift at Bots n' Beyond, the newest store for robots & androids alike.
- Manage customers as they come at you from all angles
- If they greet you before you greet them, GAME OVER

The bots' eyes tell what kind of service they need:
- Green eyes mean they're ready to check out

- Blue eyes signify a need for a product return

- Red/brown means BUSINESS, they want to speak with a manager or customer service

Look for hints telling you which wat to turn to find the customers!
